## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The project began with a foundational codebase that included:
1. A basic environment setup for the pirate agent.
2. Initial implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.
3. Predefined neural network architectures for experimentation.

I extended the provided code by:
1. Implementing custom reward functions to better guide the agent's learning process.
2. Designing and training a neural network model tailored to the specific challenges of the pirate environment.
3. Developing additional scripts for data visualization and performance analysis.
## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larget field of computer science:
This project exemplifies the intersection of reinforcement learning and neural networks, two pivotal areas in modern computer science.
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are problem solvers who design algorithms and systems to tackle complex challenges. Their work is crucial in advancing technology and improving various aspects of daily life, from healthcare to entertainment.
### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by:
1. Clearly defining the problem and understanding the requirements.
2. Breaking down the problem into manageable components.
3. Iteratively designing, testing, and refining solutions.
4. Leveraging existing knowledge and tools while being open to innovative approaches.
### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethically, I am responsible for ensuring that the solutions I develop are fair, transparent, and respect user privacy. It is crucial to consider the potential impact of technology on society and strive to create systems that benefit all stakeholders.
